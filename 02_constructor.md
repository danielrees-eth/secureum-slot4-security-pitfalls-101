### 9. Constructor names:

Before solc `0.4.22`, **constructor names** had to be the **same name as the contract** class containing it. Misnaming it wouldnâ€™t make it a constructor which has security implications.

Solc `0.4.22` introduced the `constructor` keyword.

Until solc `0.5.0`, contracts could have **both old-style and **new-style constructor names** with the first defined one taking precedence over the second if both existed, which also led to security issues.

**FORCED PRACTICE**: Solc `0.5.0` forced the use of the `constructor` keyword.

### 10. Void constructor:

**AVOID**: Calls to **unimplemented base contract constructors** leads to misplaced assumptions.

**BEST PRACTICE**: Check if the constructor is implemented or remove call if not.

### 11. Implicit constructor callValue check:

**BUG SUMMARY**: The **creation code** of a `contract` that **does not define a `constructor()` but has a base that does**, did **not `revert`** for calls with non-zero `callValue` when such a constructor was not explicitly `payable`. This is due to a compiler bug introduced in `v0.4.5` and fixed in `v0.6.8`.

**DESCRIPTION**:
- Starting from Solidity `0.4.5` the **creation code** of contracts without explicit `payable` constructor is supposed to contain a `callvalue` check that results in contract creation **reverting**, if non-zero value is passed.
- However, this **check was missing** if **no explicit constructor was defined** in a contract at all, but the contract has a base that does define a constructor.
- In these cases it is **possible to send value** in a **contract creation transaction** or using **inline assembly** without `revert`, even though the creation code is supposed to be non-payable.
